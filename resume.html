        <ul>
            <li>
                <b id="proj">Assignment 1 - Recipe</b><br>
                A website with an index, recipe, and external link that teaches you to make cookies using Sensient ingredients. There's a page with the ingredients and the recipe and a link to the Sensient website. The index links to the index, the recipe links to the recipe, and the external link, "Sensient" opens a new tab to Sensient's website.
            </li> 
            <li>
                <b id="proj">Assignment 2 - Resume</b><br>
                A website that, much like this page, is a resume. This one is a lot less specific though and uses fake projects. It is the first assignment with CSS and uses it to make fun colors. It does not link to any other files.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b id="proj">Assignemt 3 - Universe</b> <br>
                This website is the first that uses pictures and CSS boxes. It has a description of the universe and links to the Universe wikipedia. Mine has some issues I haven't worked out.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b id="proj">Assignment 4 - Registration</b> <br>
                The first assignment that used a table and a form. It's a fillable, fake registration website that lets you input your name, email, gender, and more. It also autofills a file afterwards with the information submitted.
            </li>
            <li>
                <b id="proj">Assignment 5 - Personal website</b> <br>
                Woah, you're in this one. Weird huh? Can you see yourself if you turn around? It's strange, since I haven't finished this project I don't know how it turned out but you do.
            </li>
