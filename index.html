        <h3>About Me</h3>
        <p>I am Avery, I like to build things and fly rockets. I was born and raised in Washington. When I was but a wee lad of 0 years, 0 months, 0 days, and 9 minutes old my twin was born. Since then I have gone to school, played with dogs, traveled, slept, and much more.</p>
        <p>My whole life I've had dogs. When I was born my parents owned two keeshond dogs, alongside whome I grew up. They were sweet hearts that kept me and my brother company, they helped raise us. Since then we've had a minimum of 2 dogs, and my parents currently have 4. I want a dog really bad now. That would be so cool.</p>
        <p>Now I like riding motorcycles, building rockets, and playing video games. I'm in college for Mechanical Engineering. Someday it is my dream to work on spacecraft and rovers, and help fix the earth's dying climate.</p>
